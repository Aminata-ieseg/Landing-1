                   Where does fashion stand regarding its commitment to diversity since the brand announced its support for the Black Lives Matter movement? First stocks in Paris, New York, Milan, and London. Regarding this topic, many brands had to change their perspective and adopt a more inclusive brand image.  "We are determined to dispel the misconception that Italians are synonymous with being white." decided. In July 2020, following the Black Lives Matter protests, she founded the We are Made in Italy (WAMI) Commission with the support of the CNMI to "prohibit all forms of discrimination." To the black community in fashion. " On February 24th, the group opened Milan Fashion Week and made Italian fashion history. First victory after rejecting "pressure and intimidation" from the people involved in the field. “The truth is that it took a lot of painful human sacrifice. We also have to thank America for the inspiration,” commented the designer. This exemplary effort speaks volumes about the state of diversity in an industry as powerful as fashion. “2020 was a year marked by the murder of George Floyd (an African-American man murdered by white police officers in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, editor’s note). , this drama is a defining moment of the 21st century: riots erupted across America and the Black Lives Matter movement spread internationally across cultures and societies," said Dinah, stylist and trends analyst at Peclaire. The Sultan turns around. The shockwave hit the fashion world and exposed inequalities among the American public and the rest of the world. Many brands and industry influencers have joined the movement by campaigning against police brutality and demanding better representation of minorities within their teams. Since then, the question has arisen: Where does fashion stand in terms of its commitment to diversity?

                <p>
                 When it comes to parades, representativeness, and inclusivity are on the rise. According to FashionSpot's website, 41.3% of models are in color, and spring/summer 2021 fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan, and Paris confirm trends for summer 2020, considered the most mixed season. became a thing. The development seems even more encouraging given that Covid-19 has split the number of models into three. Paris (38.9%) is certainly ahead of Milan (35.6%), but still lags behind London (52%) and New York (57.1%). However, the Big Apple posted a 7-point (50.7%) drop in the Fall/Winter 2021 season. If we see more diversity on the runway and in advertising, when will it really happen in fashion companies?
